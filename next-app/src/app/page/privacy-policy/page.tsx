          <h5 className='font-semibold'>Sending Emails</h5>
          <p>
            We use emails to communicate with you, to send information that you
            have requested. We also provide email links, as on our contact us
            page, to allow you to contact us directly. We strive to promptly

            The information you send to us may be stored and used to improve

          <h5 className='font-semibold'>Only If We Have To</h5>
          <p>
            As stated previously in this policy, we will never give out your
            information. The only exceptions to this are, when we are required
            by law, in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in
            order to conform to the edicts of the law, or we must comply with a
            legal process served on our web site.
          </p>
          <h5 className='font-semibold'>Changes In Our Practices</h5>
          <p>
            If we change our information handling practices or other privacy
            aspects, we will post those changes on this privacy statement, at
            least 30 days prior to their implementation.
          </p>
          <h5 className='font-semibold'>Surveys</h5>
          <p>
            From time-to-time our site requests information from users via
            surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and
            the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this
            information. Information requested may include contact information
            (such as name and country of residence), and demographic information
            (such as zip code, age level). Survey information will be used for
            purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this
            site.
